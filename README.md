# Minigame: Assassin
This is a funny and intense gamemode where one player is the assassin, and the other player the target. You should be scared! The assassin can track down the target using their compass. One punch from the assassin is enough to kill the target. However, looking directly at the assassin will freeze them!  

*This gamemode was inspired by the YouTube channels [Dream](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTkXRDQl0luXxVQrRQvWS6w) and [GeorgeNotFound](https://www.youtube.com/GeorgeNotFound).*
